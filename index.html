            # Spotify recommendation system

            ---

            We all know it: starting Spotify radio listening to one of our favourite jazz songs and, a couple of songs later, ending up with Helene Fischer "Atemlos durch die Nacht". Spotify what the ... ?

            => Solution: creating a customisable recommendation algorithm.

            <small> (Actually, this never happened to me and the Spotify radio is quite remarkable.) </small>

            ---

            # What is a recommendation system?

            ---

            - recommendation systems combine information along two dimensions:
              - content (e.g. danceability, loudness, tempo of a song  )
              - collaboration (e.g. songs share the same playlist)
            - recommendation = closest distance between _current_ song and _i_ next songs as mean on both dimensions
            - (implies some distance measuring between your current song and all other songs e.g. ```cosine_similarity, polynomial_kernel, ...```)


            ---

            # How can a recommendation system become more customisable?

            ---

            *let the user choose what songs to play next!*

            1) suggest songs according to the fit over both dimensions
            2) present  songs in a visually appealing way with visually marked preselected recommendations
            3) let the user interact and customise the user's path through the music

            <small>If this was our product: x-Axis represents collaboration, y-Axis content, Hexbins aggregate small groups of songs and can be explored, add to playlist path or being removed </small>

            # Basic Product
            ---

            - let the user input a Spotify song
            - return a visual representation of recommendations based on similarity with a preselected path
            - let the user modify this path and return the modified playlist

            ---

            # Basic Way to Get There

            ---

            ## data

            - data for the content dimension: Spotify data set with song analysis well known from previous challenges
            - data for the collaboration dimension: Spotify one million playlist data set -> created by users

            ---

            ## similarity measures

            - content dimension: select one of a thousands algorithms to calculate the similarity between songs using ```loudnes```etc. as input features
            - collaboration dimension: count co-occurence of songs in playlists (similar to counting words in sentences )

            ---

            # Any ideas to make it more fancy?

            ---

            - attribute different weights to the input features - controlled by the user
            - filter results by user criteria e.g. "same genre" or "same band"
            - cluster recommendations and provide different "listening islands"
            - think of dissimilarities between songs as spanning a huge network with 1) nodes as songs and 2) links between nodes as their dissimilarity
              - find the shortest path e.g. "How do I get from Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody to Outcast's Hey Ya!"
              - or everything else with paths and network
